        <div class="img5"><h2>Summary</h2><p>Season one picks up with a new plot to the Addams Family. Wednesday and Pugsley, after attending a normal high school for regular teenagers, find themselves in a situation. After Pugsley is bullied one day at school, Wednesday decides to take revenge by dumping piranhas into the pool that the guy is swimming in with his team. He only loses a testicle, but Wednesday is sent away to her parents alma mater: Nevermore. She is given a roommate who is a werewolf, Enid, that her personality clashes with immediately. 

            However, at the same time, a monster is roaming in the woods and attacking people in the nearby town and students. Wednesday runs into it after a classmate tries to kill her and gets killed by the monster. The rest of the series is her trying to figure out who and what the monster is, while entering a love triangle with a barista boy in town and another one of her classmates. There are other moments thrown in throughout because they really needed something to keep this show going for eight episodes. 
            
            Theres a class tournament thats honestly kind of lame, bee boy, family night where we find out Wednesdays father killed a guy while at school, and Wednesday attempting to solve all of this with Thing, the hand that follows her around. Honestly, I dont know how they stretched this much for eight episodes. It goes quick, but it starts to get a little old after a while. I think Wednesdays one-liners are good, but they become repetitive and predictable after about episode five.
            
            The final plot twist here is the monster, who ends up being one of the boys in the love triangle, is being controlled by the botany teacher. The botany teacher apparently wants to revive her ancestor, the head Pilgrim guy, that hates anyone who wasnt fully human. She does revive him, kills the principal, Weems, and then theres this epic takedown. An implication for season two thus comes up at the end, as monster boy, Tyler, seems to escape the van he being contained within by police. 
            
            Theres a lot to think about the decisions made during this show. I have a couple major points that had me very confused throughout watching this show.
            
                Isnt the point of the Addams family to show how much of the family they are while defying the expectations of the nuclear family? The Addams Family was created in the thirties and named as popular culture in the sixties. Yet, in this show, Wednesday is fairly isolated from her family members and actually has a riff between her mother and her.
            
                Why is a Black mayor concerned about the Pilgrims? Also, why does Morticia say to him that he doesnt understand what it means to be understood or believed by people? There is a very specific connotation when you say that to a Black person.  
            
                If Nevermore is such a school for outcasts, why are its students so normal?
            
                What was the point of the love triangle? Wednesday is mean to both of these boys and theyre obsessed with her. The show then unfolds like a Y/N fanfic—I literally was counting the fanfiction tropes that were appearing throughout the episodes. 
            
                The writing just seems kind of lazy at some points. I think the characters were fleshed out in a way they could in such a short time frame, but they feel so static and archetypical. </p></div>
